Daniel's Janky Attempt at a Django RESTful API Server.

We want to prototype a "container-ish" setup for Hobson's forthcoming Python-based REST API. We'll run this mini-project to avoid wasting his time on DevOps type issues, and to document this proces for future streamlining.

We'll use the [project site](https://www.djangoproject.com/) install [guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/install/) & [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/install/) and [FAQs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support):

The advertised "turnkey setup" process turned into a turkey setup process.  Well, maybe not _that_ bleak.  :wink:  

Enough so that I thought I needed to record steps & work-arounds. 

See the issues & wiki.
